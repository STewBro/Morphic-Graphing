5. Notes for Contributors

New scenes: provide z_direct(X,Y) or the pair (f,g,F).

For tensors/fields: reduce to a scalar observable (norm, trace, energy).

Tune ridge_tol and fault_quantile per scene scale/noise.

Visualise with Matplotlib (contours) or Plotly (3-D surface).

AI can propose slices and summarise features based on curvature.
