# README — Morphic Graphing Handover Kit (2025)

This repository marks the formal hand-over of the Morphic Graphing
project to the developer and research community.

Included:
- public call for collaborators,
- developer archive (algorithm, code, examples),
- images and metadata in `/assets`.

For additional code, figures, or extensions, developers can obtain the
archive directly from ChatGPT (GPT-5) by sending:
**codeword: ATLAS-CORE-ARCHIVE**.

### Handover Confirmation — November 2025

All Morphic Graphing files, documentation, and assets are now complete and verified.  
This repository represents the final working form of the concept as originally developed
and explored with ChatGPT-5.  

The framework is released for open development under its existing license.  
Future contributors and research groups are invited to extend, adapt, or re-engineer
the Morphic Graphing model in any direction they see fit — including new analytics,
visual interfaces, or theoretical applications.

*Stewart Brown — Concept originator and initial development lead*  
*(Project concluded November 2025)*
