description: >
  Surface illustrating how spatial separation (x) and energy ratio (y)
  interact to define event resolvability, blending quantum uncertainty
  with relativistic locality.
equation:
  z: exp(- (|x| / (1 + 1/y))^2) * (1 + 1/y^2)
axes:
  x_label: Normalised spatial separation (s / λC)
  x_range: [-3, 3]
  y_label: Energy ratio (U / U0)
  y_range: [1, 10]
  z_label: Relative resolvability R(x, y)
notes: |
  - Fold near y≈1 and x≈0 indicates tension of quantum and relativistic limits.
  - Higher y flattens the surface (classical-like regime).
