> **Release Note – November 2025**  
> This repository now contains the full working concept of **Morphic Graphing**,  
> including the new **Multi-Analytic Extensions** (Section 6) and example  
> implementation (`examples_spectral.py`).  
> The model demonstrates how different analytic operators (Fourier, wavelet, etc.)  
> can be used within morphic graphing to reveal alternative structural views of the

> All assets and documentation are complete and ready for open development.

# Morphic-Graphing
Developers and researchers are invited to explore, extend, or refactor the model—see Section 6 for the new multi-analytic framework.
## About this project

**Morphic Graphing** is an open, experimental framework for exploring how physical
and mathematical laws can be projected into *responsive geometric spaces*.  
By placing a *law* along one axis and an *operator or analytic* along another,
the method reveals the inner structure of equations — how they interact,
overlap, and evolve — through visual topographies rather than algebraic form.

This repository provides:
- Core algorithms for generating morphic surfaces.
- Example scripts including quantum–relativity, oscillator, and multi-analytic cases.
- Reference assets and documentation for developers.

The long-term aim is to build a shared **Atlas of Scientific Concepts**:
a living map of how fundamental equations relate when visualised through
different analytic perspectives.

## For future development

This repository is released as an open starting point for independent
development and experimentation.  
Potential next directions include:

- Extending the morphic-graphing core to handle additional analytics
  (e.g., Green’s functions, sensitivity maps, probabilistic operators).
- Building an interactive visual interface for navigating morphic surfaces.
- Developing AI-assisted routines for selecting or combining analytics.
- Integrating the concept into educational visualisation tools.

The project is intentionally left open-ended: new contributors are free
to interpret, refactor, or expand it in their own way while retaining
the central idea — that the geometry of equations can itself be explored
as a conceptual landscape.
