> **Release Note – November 2025**  
> This repository now contains the full working concept of **Morphic Graphing**,

> implementation (`examples_spectral.py`).  
> The model demonstrates how different analytic operators (Fourier, wavelet, etc.)

> All assets and documentation are complete and ready for open development.

# Morphic-Graphing
Developers and researchers are invited to explore, extend, or refactor the model—see Section 6 for the new multi-analytic framework.
## About this project

**Morphic Graphing** is an open, experimental framework for exploring how physical
and mathematical laws can be projected into *responsive geometric spaces*.  
By placing a *law* along one axis and an *operator or analytic* along another,
the method reveals the inner structure of equations — how they interact,
overlap, and evolve — through visual topographies rather than algebraic form.

This repository provides:
- Core algorithms for generating morphic surfaces.
- Example scripts including quantum–relativity, oscillator, and multi-analytic cases.
- Reference assets and documentation for developers.

The long-term aim is to build a shared **Atlas of Scientific Concepts**:
a living map of how fundamental equations relate when visualised through
different analytic perspectives.
