> **Release Note – November 2025**  
> This repository now contains the full working concept of **Morphic Graphing**,  
> including the new **Multi-Analytic Extensions** (Section 6) and example  
> implementation (`examples_spectral.py`).  
> The model demonstrates how different analytic operators (Fourier, wavelet, etc.)  
> can be used within morphic graphing to reveal alternative structural views of the  
> same physical law.  
> All assets and documentation are complete and ready for open development.

# Morphic-Graphing
Developers and researchers are invited to explore, extend, or refactor the model—see Section 6 for the new multi-analytic framework.
