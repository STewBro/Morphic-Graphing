# Concept-Atlas — Morphic Graphing (Handover)

This repository contains a complete **handover kit** for the
*Morphic Graphing* idea — an open approach to visualising the geometry
of scientific equations by treating laws and operators as interacting
axes in a “morphic” plot.

- **Call for developers:** see `Call_for_Developers_Morphic_Graphing.md`
- **Developer archive (full technical brief):**
  `ATLAS_CORE_ARCHIVE_Developer_Edition.md`
- **Examples and images:** in the `assets/` folder
- **License:** MIT (open use and adaptation)

**Access via ChatGPT:**  
Developers can also obtain the full archive directly by starting a chat
with ChatGPT (GPT-5) and sending the phrase:
**codeword: ATLAS-CORE-ARCHIVE**.

This project is released to the community for further development.
